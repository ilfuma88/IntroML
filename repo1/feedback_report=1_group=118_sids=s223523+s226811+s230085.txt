You set up the problem nicely by outlining the importance of water potability. You should have provided a source for the data, however, and also described if others have analyzed the data before you. You do a fine job of envisioning the regression and classification task you’re going to solve. I like that you describe the attributes qualitatively, i.e. what they each mean in addition to doing the basic statistical categorization of attributes. It would have been nice to have a summary table showing all this, even if they are all more or less the same category. However, you write things like “.. usually measured in units like X or Y”. That’s fine, but it would make sense then to maybe specify the actual unit used in your data. You’re missing some summary statistics of your data, e.g. a table showing the min, max, mean and percentiles of each attribute, and ideally also separate boxplots showing the distribution for the samples that are potable and non-potable, respectively. You could have alleviated this problem slightly if you had shown all distributions rather than just the pH and hardness, although the bar plot isn’t really ideal for summary statistics. For the same reason, I cannot validate your reasoning for not looking for outliers except for pH. The correlation matrix is fine, and you correctly reason that dimensionality reduction will be difficult with this little correlation between your attributes. Furthermore, pie charts are generally not a good way to visualize anything,  since it’s incredibly hard to gauge the relative size of different slices. It’s not too bad in your case, but please do not use pie charts generally. Also, you do not mention any normalization or standardization of data. It was an important part of the project to evaluate the importance of this and carry this out if necessary. You decompose the principal directions of the PCs correctly, and they are indeed hard to draw any useful conclusions from, which is also shown by your projection of the data onto the considered principal components. This also leads you to the somewhat correct observation that it might not be straightforward to classify the potability in the next project. However, I do not understand your claim that the variance in the attributes makes it more difficult. Normally, you do need variance to be able to classify, but the crucial part is whether the distributions are different between the groups of the target variable. This is where something like separate boxplots for the two target variable classes could have been very useful for you - if you could show that the data distribution is more or less the same in the potable samples as in the non-potable samples, you would be led to the conclusion that classification would likely be hard. In the context of this project, Figure 1.7 seems superfluous compared to Figure 1.5 which implicitly contains the effect of much more attributes through the PCs. I think that overall Figure 1.4 and 1.5 provide you with the most clues as to whether your machine learning aim seems feasible, and I am missing an explicit comment on this. Overall, this report is good but has several obvious flaws.
